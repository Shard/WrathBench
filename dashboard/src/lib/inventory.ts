/**
 * Arranging one inventory sample into a bag grid and a paperdoll, and the
 * trace's character sheet into such a sample.
 *
 * Pure, and separate from the markup, because every interesting decision here
 * is about absent data rather than about layout. A run recorded before track
 * A's columns exists carries only `{name, count, equipped}`: no id, no
 * quality, no slot, no bag position. Newer runs carry some or all of them. The
 * panel has to be honest in every one of those states, and "honest" is what
 * these functions pin:
 *
 *  - no slot on a worn item: it is listed under the paperdoll as slot unknown,
 *    never placed in a square we guessed at. A guessed square would be a claim
 *    about the character that no observation supports.
 *  - no bag position on a carried item: the grid falls back to name order, so
 *    the cells at least stop reshuffling between samples.
 *  - `null` items is "this run recorded no inventory", which is not the same
 *    as an empty bag; the callers keep that distinction.
