/**
 * The map's chat bubbles: what a character said, above its pip, for a while
 * after it said it.
 *
 * The lines are the trace's (`chat` events, `runner/viewer/trace.ts`): each
 * character's own outgoing say, party, raid, yell, whisper and emote lines as
 * the server echoed them back. A party's lines are therefore each said once,
 * above the one who said them: another member's copy of the same line is
 * never recorded.
 *
 * Time is the map's playhead, never the wall clock: the replay's cursor, and
 * live the delayed playhead the pips are placed by, which runs at 1× — so a
 * bubble stays for `BUBBLE_MS` of the run's own time either way, and appears
 * when the pip reaches the moment it was said rather than when the feed
 * brought it in.
 *
 * Pure, so it is pinned by tests; `MapPage.tsx` only draws what this returns.
