/**
 * The unit frame's arithmetic, kept pure so the bars are checked here rather

 *
 * The frame is modelled on the client's own: a health bar, a power bar tinted
 * by the character's power type, and an experience bar with the level in a
 * badge where the portrait's ring would be. Colours are the client's
 * `PowerBarColor` triples (mana 0/0/1, rage 1/0/0, energy 1/1/0, focus
 * 1/.5/.25, runic power 0/.82/1) pulled toward the page in each scheme, as
 * custom properties in `styles.css`; this file only names them.
 *
 * What the feed carries decides what draws. Level and xp are on every
 * `AgentPosition`; health, power, the power type and the class ride with them
 * since, but a run recorded before that carries none, so a bar whose
 * numbers are absent renders as *unobserved* — an empty track with a dash —
 * rather than as zero. Undefined means unobserved, never zero, the same rule
 * the SDK holds.
