/**
 * The quest log at the playhead, from the trace's character sheet.
 *
 * The sheet carries the log as numbers (`runner/src/trace-row.ts`): each
 * slot's quest id, its state and its four objective counters, and beside them
 * the counts each quest needs (`qreq`, the segment's own dictionary). Nothing
 * here names a quest: the trace records no title and the public projection
 * publishes none, so the panel links each id to Wowhead and the reader's
 * browser asks for the name (`questUrl`).
 *
 * What is pinned here is the join, client-style:
 *
 *  - a creature, gameobject or event objective is its counter against the
 *    quest's count for that counter, the four in the log's order;
 *  - a collect objective has no counter in the log at all. Its progress is
 *    what is carried — equipped, worn bags, the backpack and the worn bags'
 *    contents, as the server's `Player::GetItemCount(id, false)` counts it and
 *    the SDK's `questObjectives` reads it — capped at the count needed, as the
 *    server keeps it (`AdjustQuestReqItemCount`). The server also counts the
 *    keyring, which the sheet does not read, so a key reads 0; the panel
 *    shows objectives only while a quest is in progress, so a complete
 *    quest's key is never shown as missing;
 *  - the state is the slot's `QuestSlotStateMask` (AzerothCore `Player.h`):
 *    bit 1 complete, bit 2 failed;
 *  - a quest the segment carries no counts for has no objectives rather than
 *    zeros, and an objective with no counter and no count (exploration, a
 *    scripted event) is invisible in the counts, so its quest shows only its
 *    state.
 *
 * `null` is "the sheet cannot say" — a segment from before the sheet, the
 * stretch after a sandbox restart before the character's own create block —
 * and an empty list is an observed empty log. There is no coarser reading to
 * fall back to: the 60 s state line carries a count of turn-ins, not the log.
