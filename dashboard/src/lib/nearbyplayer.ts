/**
 * The nearby player: the units around each live character, at the same
 * playhead the trace player places the character's pip at, so an NPC and the
 * pip it is fighting line up however far behind the feed the map runs.
 *
 * Pure, like the trace player, and in pieces the map wires:
 *
 * - **A store** (`createNearbyStore`) of each run's newest window
 *   (`/api/run/<id>/nearby`), decoded once. A window reaches back further than
 *   the live delay, so the newest one alone answers the playhead; nothing is
 *   merged across polls.
 * - **Sampling** (`dotsAt`): every unit in view of any run on the map at `t`,
 *   once — a unit two characters both see is one guid and one dot, taken from
 *   the window with the newest data, and engaged if it targets either of them.
 * - **Classes** (`classOf`), from packet fields only: dead, engaged with the
 *   character, another player, a service NPC, anything else. No reaction
 *   colour: that needs `FactionTemplate.dbc`, which nothing here reads.
 * - **Labels** (`cullLabels`): greedy, highest priority first, so a city's
 *   names do not pile up.
 * - **The throttle** (`nearbyFrameDue`): NPCs nearly always move, and drawing
 *   them every frame would hold the whole map at the display's rate.
 *
 * The codec is `runner/viewer/nearby.ts`, reached over `@viewer/nearby`.
