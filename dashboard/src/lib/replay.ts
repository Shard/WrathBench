 * position at the departure flight master for the whole flight, so the flight
 * shows up as one jump at the landing, which by speed is a hearthstone; and a
 * release to a nearby graveyard is slower than a mounted ride. So, in order,
 * each overriding the last:
 *
 * - **Flights**, from the `taxi` / `taxi_landed` milestones. A milestone is
 *   written in the state sample that observed it, so the takeoff sample `t` is
 *   the first point at or after the mark and the landing sample `l` likewise;
 *   everything from `t` to `l` flew. Two shapes are on the record:
 *   - *Held* rows (every run so far): `t` onwards sits on the departure
 *     point, and the jump to the landing comes on the first segment that moves
 *     — sometimes the one ending at `l`, sometimes one sample later, depending
 *     on when the position caught up. That segment is the flight's one
 *     straight coloured line (two, where a multi-hop flight caught up at a node
 *     on the way).
 *   - *Moving* rows (an SDK that tracks the flight): each segment in the
 *     window is coloured, and so is the one ending at `t`, since the takeoff
 *     happened inside it.
 * - **Teleports**, hidden: a graveyard release (the segment ending at the
 *   sample that saw it), a hearthstone (every segment from its dispatch to
 *   `HEARTH_LANDS_WITHIN_MS` after), and a move the module ended `teleported`
 *   or `transferred`.
 * - **Map changes**, hidden: a sample on another map breaks the line rather
 *   than being stepped over, so a Deeprun Tram ride between two map-0 samples
 *   no longer joins them.
 * - **The speed backstop** (`JUMP_SPEED_YPS`), for walk segments only: a held
 *   flight's landing jump is a flight segment by now, and stays drawn.
 *
 * Pure and computed once per track: the cursor only slices it (`routeUpTo`).
