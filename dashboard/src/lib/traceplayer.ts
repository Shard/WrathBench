/**
 * The trace player: where a character was, and in what state, at the instant
 * a reader is looking at — the one source the live map (private and public)
 * and the replay both draw from, so the map moves like the characters do
 * rather than in one jump per sample.
 *
 * Three pieces, all pure, none touching the DOM:
 *
 * - **A store** (`createTraceStore`) of decoded segments per run, bounded, and
 *   laid end to end so the codec's `sampleAt` reads several windows as one,
 *   with the open tail standing in for the windows not closed yet. It decides
 *   what to fetch, and it refuses any window it was not told exists: a segment
 *   is requested only once a feed has listed its `t0` (a position's `recent`,
 *   a track's `segs`), because the public edge caches a 404 for a day and an
 *   unlisted window is a 404 until the publisher reaches it.
 * - **A live clock** (`createLiveClock`): a playhead running at 1× a delay
 *   behind the feed — a jitter buffer, sized from the source's own cadence so
 *   the next arrival lands before the playhead runs out of data.
 * - **A replay clock** (`replayCursorAt`): the transport's playhead at a
 *   wall-clock speed, with the record's idle gaps compressed (`playback.ts`).
 *
 * Both clocks are functions of `performance.now()` from an anchor and never a
 * sum of frames: a background tab stops drawing, and when it wakes the
 * playhead is wherever the anchor puts it now rather than where it stopped.
 *
 * The codec is `runner/viewer/trace.ts`, reached over `@viewer/trace` at
 * runtime; this file decides what to play and when, never how a segment reads.
