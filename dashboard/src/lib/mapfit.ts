/**
 * When the map's camera moves on its own: the fit.
 *
 * Fitting is deliberate, not reactive. The view is fitted on a few occasions
 * only: the first map to appear, a track load, a chip click, a replay's
 * cursor crossing to another continent, and a pick from the sidebar's live
 * list, which frames that one character. It never refits on a mere change of
 * `activeMap`, because an unrelated agent logging out can flip which map is
 * busiest, and yanking a panned view out from under an operator for that would
 * be hostile. So a fit is asked for and then made once someone stands on the
 * active map. Asked for with nobody there, it waits for the feed to bring
 * someone.
 *
 * The ask is a plain flag rather than a signal, and that is why `askNow`
 * exists. An ask made from an effect can come after the fit effect has
 * already run for the very change that prompted it, and nothing then wakes
 * the fit effect again. That is what a replay's cursor crossing a continent
 * did. `cursorMap` subscribes to the feed only once a track exists, so it
 * sits behind the fit effect among the feed's observers, and the fit ran
 * first, with nothing asked. The camera then stayed on the old continent's
 * coordinates over the new continent's tiles (open sea, no pip) until some
 * unrelated feed change. Privately that came within a poll, when the tail
 * grew. On the public site, whose tail is fixed until the next publish, a
 * replay paused at its end stayed blank for minutes. A crossing or a chip
 * click therefore fits on the spot, from the graph as it stands. An ask
 * that should wait, such as a load whose trace has not arrived, uses `ask`.
