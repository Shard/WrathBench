# @wrathbench/sdk

The surface the model programs against. Thin typed wrappers over the module's
HTTP/WebSocket protocol (`module/PROTOCOL.md`), a typed event stream, and a
state cache built purely from events.

The SDK's public shape is part of the harness version (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).
Adding to it is a minor bump. Changing or removing anything exported from
`src/index.ts` is a major bump and wants a note in `docs/METHODOLOGY.md`. Two
consequences worth stating: helpers are added because a run needed them, never
in anticipation; and the cache never exposes a field no event carried, because
a field that appears and later becomes trustworthy is a silent contract change.

## At a glance

```ts
import { connect } from "@wrathbench/sdk";

const client = await connect({ baseUrl: "http://worldserver:8086", token: "run-1" });

await client.health();
const session = await client.createSession({ character: "Benchy", race: 1, class: 1 });

await client.say("hello world");
const echo = await client.waitForChat("hello world", { timeout: 5000 });

const target = await client.waitForNearby(
  (o) => o.objectType?.value === "unit" && o.name !== undefined && o.position !== undefined,
);
const move = await client.moveTo(target.position!.value, { timeout: 60_000 });
if (!move.ok) console.log("could not get there:", move.status);

console.log(client.state.self.position?.value);
await client.logout();
client.close();
```

`connect` opens the event subscription *before* any session exists, on purpose:
`POST /session` blocks for the whole login handshake, so `SMSG_CHAR_ENUM` and
`SMSG_LOGIN_VERIFY_WORLD` arrive while that call is still in flight. Subscribing
first is what makes the state cache complete.

### Client

`sdk/API.md` is the generated, exhaustive reference and is what the model is
given.

`raw()` is not a helper: it queues one allowlisted client opcode with a
caller-built body. It is the escape hatch the surface philosophy promises
(`docs/METHODOLOGY.md`, "The model surface") — the way a trajectory shows a
surface is needed before one is built, not a second path to any helper. The allowlist is `module/PROTOCOL.md` ("raw").

Every guid — state fields, helper returns, and every guid argument — is an
opaque decimal string, which is also exactly what the wire carries:
compare with `===`, use as Map keys, `JSON.stringify` freely. A `number` guid
is rejected loudly (precision loss); a bigint you conjure yourself is converted
for you. Why strings: BigInt was the top error class of the first measured
night and never load-bearing at the model surface, so the SDK may use bigint
internally and never lets one escape. Session-scoped short aliases were
rejected: they die on reconnect, so a stale alias silently names the wrong
unit — the forbidden class. Representation is fair game to optimize;
referents are not.

Wherever a helper or raw action takes a guid, it also takes the name of a
unit, item, spell, talent, faction or taxi node the model can currently
observe (`docs/METHODOLOGY.md`, "A name in view is a valid referent, with
bounded fuzz"; `src/resolve.ts` is the shared resolver). Resolution is
deterministic and narrow: normalise case, whitespace and apostrophes; exact
match, else a unique substring, else a unique match within a small edit
distance. One candidate acts; none refuses with what is in view; two or more
refuse and list them. Opcode names and guids themselves are never fuzzed.

### Combat, loot and quests

`killTarget` owns the whole melee loop, and each part of it is there because a
live run needed it: a synthesized character never auto-faces the way a client
does and the server drops a swing that is not facing its victim, so the target
is faced before the first swing and re-faced during the fight; the character
walks into melee range before that first swing and is walked back whenever the target
drifts out of it; our own death ends it at once. Statuses are `killed` (the
target's observed health reached zero), `player_died`, `lost` (it left view
alive), `timeout`, and `aborted_low_health` when `abortBelowHealthPct` was given
and our own health fell under it. There is deliberately no `evaded`: nothing on
the whitelist says "evade", and naming a status the module never uttered would
be an SDK invention in a field that otherwise only holds the world's words.

The one thing to know before composing with it: a single `CMSG_ATTACKSWING`
makes the server swing until it is cancelled, and moving does not cancel it. So
`killTarget` sends `attack_stop` only when the fight is over (`killed`,
`player_died`, `aborted_low_health`) or when `disengage: true` was passed —
`timeout` and `lost` leave the character swinging, because disarming a
half-fought mob is how a character dies standing still. `attacking` says which
happened and `detail` says it in words. If the server cancels our auto-attack
mid-fight (`SMSG_ATTACKSTOP` with the target still alive), the loop swings
again. The default `timeout` is 25s, deliberately under the runner's 30s
snippet cap; longer fights belong in a background routine.

`lootCorpse` sends `loot_all` — the module replaying the client's auto-loot
sequence — and returns once the window has been emptied and released. A
chest-type game object goes the way a client opens one (`docs/CONTRACTS.md`,
the action contract): the helper casts the lock's Opening spell at it and
sends the store/money/release sequence itself once the window arrives; a
chest none of the Opening spells fits is
`{ ok: false, status: "not_opened", reason, hint }`. `interact(guid)` on a
chest is refused with `{ status: "chest" }` and a hint, because the ack it
would return means nothing. Its `items` are what `SMSG_ITEM_PUSH_RESULT`
confirmed *stored*, not what the window displayed (the window is an offer; the
pushes are the receipt — a possible no-op is never reported as success). A
corpse with nothing on it releases without ever opening a window, which is
`{ ok: false, status: "empty" }`: an answer, not a failure.
A window that showed items of which not one entered a bag — bags full, or a
broken store path — is `{ ok: false, status: "none_stored" }`. Silence still
throws `EventTimeoutError`.

`questsAvailableFrom` is that same send-and-wait with none of the accepting:
it returns whatever the NPC offers right now, `{ ok: true, quests: [...] }`,
and an empty list is an answer rather than an error. It exists because models
kept rebuilding it by hand over `questList` plus event scraping and getting
confused by their own nulls.

`acceptQuestFrom` reads the quest log *first*, because a turn-in chain may
already have added the quest (the core auto-advances, so an explicit accept can
be a no-op) — that is `status: "already_in_log"`. Otherwise it asks, and
accepts the list in either shape: a gossip-flagged questgiver answers
`quest_list` with an `SMSG_GOSSIP_MESSAGE` carrying the quests, not an
`SMSG_QUESTGIVER_QUEST_LIST`. `turnInQuest` handles the other branch of the
same asymmetry: `SMSG_QUESTGIVER_REQUEST_ITEMS` that says the quest *is*
completable is the client's cue to send the completion again. The completion
wait races `SMSG_INVENTORY_CHANGE_FAILURE`: a reward that does not fit is
answered with that failure and no completion at all, so a full bag comes back
as `{ ok: false, status: "inventory_full", hint }` instead of burning the
whole timeout (the quest stays in the log; free a slot and turn in again).

`waitForQuestObjective` waits on the **quest log**, not on an event, because at
the pinned commit the core sends no `SMSG_QUESTUPDATE_COMPLETE` for a kill
objective: the only thing that reports one to a client is the completion bit in
the served quest-log state field.

`trainerList` asks a trainer what it teaches and derives two things per row
that are not on the wire: `learnable` (the server's own green state, via the
single `TRAINER_SPELL_STATE` mapping) and `affordable` (observed money against
`cost`, `undefined` while money is unobserved — never guessed). They are
independent: the server's state says nothing about money, so a green spell can
still fail to buy. The core's handler answers nothing at all when the NPC is
out of interact range, is not a trainer, or trains another class, so all three
arrive as an `EventTimeoutError` saying so. `buySpell` races
`SMSG_TRAINER_BUY_SUCCEEDED` against `SMSG_TRAINER_BUY_FAILED` for the spell
id and returns `{ status: "learned" }` or `{ status: "buy_failed", reason,
hint }` — the raw reason plus one actionable sentence, never an exception,
because a refusal is the game answering.

`deleteCharacter` retries on its own, and that belongs in the SDK rather than
in a caller: for up to about a minute after logout the core still tracks an
offline session for the character and silently ignores `CMSG_CHAR_DELETE`,
which surfaces as `504 timeout` (or as an aborted request, if the module's
internal wait outlasts `requestTimeoutMs`). `account_in_use` is the same
not-yet-released transient seen from the other side. All three mean "not
released yet" and are retried with a fresh throwaway token each time; anything
else the module says (`character_not_found`, a `char_delete_failed_code_<N>`)
is a real answer and is thrown.

The SDK reads no environment: the bearer credential every route requires —
the port secret for operator tooling, the run's lease secret for a snippet
child — is passed in by the caller (`ConnectOptions.secret`).

Helpers stop where they stop because this is what the probes and
`infra/smoke/one-quest.ts` have actually needed. Nothing is added in
anticipation.

### Movement

`moveTo` issues `move_to`, then resolves on the `WB_MOVE_RESULT` carrying the
same `moveId`. **Game outcomes are returned, not thrown**
(`docs/METHODOLOGY.md`, "The model surface"): `arrived` is `ok: true`; every
failure status is `ok: false` with the status intact and a per-status `hint`,
and *every* move result carries the server-confirmed position the character
actually ended at. A snippet that forgets a `try` should not lose a run to a
wall, and "there is no path there" is an answer, not an error.

Two things still throw:

- `WrathRequestError` — the request was refused before anything moved
  (`missing_position`, `not_in_world`, …).
- `EventTimeoutError` — no result arrived within `timeout` (default 90s: the
  ~250yd single-move cap is ~36s of running, plus the module's server-confirmation
  deadline). That is the *absence* of an outcome — the character may still be
  walking — so it is not dressed up as a `status`. Inventing a
  `status: "timeout"` would put an SDK fabrication in a field that otherwise
  only holds the module's words. The corollary: an SDK-side status is legal
  only when it describes the SDK declining to act (`unknown_target`, `lost`)
  — never a renamed or inferred server outcome.

A `moveTo` issued while another is running supersedes it, and the older call
returns `status: "superseded"`. `stop()` returns as soon as the module has
queued the `MSG_MOVE_STOP` — it does *not* wait for the character to halt; it is
the in-flight `moveTo` that resolves, with `status: "stopped"`, once the stop
has landed. Read the position off that result rather than off the cache right
after `await client.stop()`.

`waitForNearby` waits on the *cache*, not on one event: a named creature takes a
create block plus the creature-query answer the module fired on first sight, so
no single event answers "is there a named creature nearby".

### Errors: two channels, not quite two transports

- `WrathTransportError` — the request got no readable answer: socket refused,
  timeout, non-JSON body, a 2xx body that does not match the protocol.
- `WrathRequestError` — the module answered `{ ok: false }`. Carries `status`,
  `code`, `body`, and `kind`:
  - `kind: "request"` — your call was wrong (`token_in_use`, `no_session`,
    `not_in_world`, `unsupported_action`, …).
  - `kind: "game"` — the *server* decided (`char_create_failed_code_<N>` — the
    numeric code is parsed out into `charCreateResultCode` — plus `login_failed`
    and `timeout`). These come back as HTTP only because `POST /session` is
    synchronous; the same outcome is also on the event stream.

Everything the server decides *after* an action is acked never appears as an
error at all. It arrives as an event, because that is how a client would learn
of it — a muted `say` is a `SMSG_NOTIFICATION`, not a 4xx.

Unknown error codes parse fine; `ErrorCode` is a widened string union so a new
module code costs autocompletion, not correctness.

### Event stream

`client.events.connect()` reopens the stream after a `close()` — a consumer
that hung up can dial again, and the gap accounting carries across, so the
events emitted while it was down arrive as one `stream_gap`. What `close()` really ended stays ended: the waits it rejected and
the async iterators it finished belong to the caller that closed them.

`waitFor` searches the retained buffer *before* waiting, so a wait issued
after an action was acked can still find an event that arrived during the
call.

Three ways an event can be less than fully typed, none of which drop it:

- `data` is `{ decodeError: true }` — the module could not decode a whitelisted
  packet. Use `isDecodeError(event.data)`.
- `schemaError` is set — the opcode is whitelisted but the payload did not match
  this SDK revision's schema. `isEvent(event, opcode)` returns false for these,
  so narrowing gives you real fields or nothing.
- the opcode is unknown to this revision — it arrives as an `UnknownEvent` with
  `data` unvalidated, so an SDK built against today's whitelist keeps streaming
  when the whitelist widens.

Two synthetic opcodes, lowercase so they can never collide with an `SMSG_*`:

- `stream_gap` — the stream reconnected across a hole. `data` is
  `{ fromSeq, toSeq, missing }`. Never suppressed: a cache is only as
  trustworthy as the stream it was fed. A `seq` that *restarts* (the session was
  torn down and recreated under the same token) is re-baselined, not reported
  as a gap.
- `stream_error` — a frame arrived that was not a readable event envelope.

### State cache

`client.state` is a `StateCache`: a pure fold over the stream.

`questLog`, `inventory`, `money`, `xp`, `nextLevelXp` and `target` are *derived
on read* from `self.fields` rather than kept as a second copy written by a
second path. There is one write seam (the field merge), so replay-equals-live
holds for them for free. The wire's shape is preserved on the way in:
the module serves `quest3State` and `invSlot23Lo` as raw per-u32
fields and this is where they are folded.

- A quest slot's four objective counters are two u32s of packed u16s, split
  into `counts[0..3]`. The log carries the *current* counts only — `required`
  lives on `SMSG_QUESTUPDATE_ADD_KILL` and the quest details — so nothing here
  compares them, and `complete` is the state field's own bit.
- `questNId === 0` is an empty slot and does not become a quest with id 0.
- An inventory slot is a three-way join: the two u32 guid halves, the item's
  own create block (for `entry`), and an item query (for the name). Each leg
  can be missing, and a slot whose item has not been created for us yet is
  still reported — it *is* occupied — with `itemId` and `name` undefined.
- `bag()` is the backpack view of `inventory`, shaped for acting on it:
  `bag`/`slot` are exactly what `equipItem`, `useItem` and `destroyItem` take,
  `count` is the observed stack count, and `freeSlots` counts the slots holding
  nothing. Earned surface: morning-opus-1 rebuilt this from push-result
  listeners, invSlot regexes and a full relog when it was already in the cache.
  One caveat: empty slots are zero fields the wire compresses away, so before
  our own create block arrives `freeSlots` reads 16.
- `pointOf(obj)` answers "where do I walk to reach it" from the freshest of the
  two independent sources: an oriented position (update blocks, `MSG_MOVE_*`)
  or `SMSG_MONSTER_MOVE`'s destination, which is what a player reads off a
  moving creature's animation.

Every observed field group is an `Observed<T> = { value, seq, ts }`, so
staleness is legible rather than implied. That matters most for position: our
own is written by `SMSG_LOGIN_VERIFY_WORLD`, then by our own create block, then
by every `WB_MOVE_PROGRESS` while we walk and by the server-confirmed
`WB_MOVE_RESULT` at the end — and between events it is stale, which the `seq`
says out loud.

The queries (`nearbyUnits`, `creaturesByEntry`, `closest`) are pure reads.
`closest` returns `undefined` when we have no position of our own, rather than
guessing one. They hand back the live cache entries; `snapshot()` is the frozen
copy.

#### How an object in view is built

`values` deltas merge **per field** (each field keeps the `seq`/`ts` of the
block that carried it, so a health number and the max it is out of can be
minutes apart and say so). A `near` block is *not* a removal and does not
prune. `names` and `creatures` are never pruned: the module will not re-issue a
query for an entry it already asked about, so a creature that walks away and
comes back would otherwise be permanently nameless.

Three consequences of "nothing is invented" worth knowing before you read a
field:

- `NearbyObject.position` is a `UnitPosition` (`x,y,z,o`) with **no map id** —
  nothing on the wire carries one for another object. Only `self.position` has
  a `map`, carried from the last `SMSG_LOGIN_VERIFY_WORLD`.
- `health`/`power` are set only when *every* part has been observed. A `values`
  delta routinely carries `health` without `maxHealth`, and which of
  `power1..7` is the character's power depends on `powerType`. Half a gauge is
  not a gauge. The raw parts are always in `obj.fields`, which is where to look
  when a gauge is `undefined`. (Seen live: a level-1 warrior's create block
  carries `powerType: 1` and `maxPower2` but no `power2`, because the current
  value is 0 and zero fields are not in the update mask — so `power` stays
  `undefined` until the first change.)
- A `create` block flagged `self` whose guid contradicts the seeded identity
  does **not** overwrite `self`. It is recorded on `state.anomalies` and filed
  as an ordinary object in view, because the cache cannot tell which of the two
  is wrong and picking silently would make it disagree with the trajectory log.

Two rules the tests enforce:

1. **Nothing is invented** (`docs/CONTRACTS.md`). A field exists only if an
   event carried it: an incomplete gauge stays `undefined` rather than being
   half-filled, an object with no `create` block has no `objectType` (and so is
   not a unit), and a chat sender does not become a nearby object — knowing who
   spoke is not knowing who is in range. A guid learned from a name query goes
   in `names`, which claims nothing spatial.
2. **Replayable.** `StateCache.replay(events, { seed })` reproduces the live
   cache exactly. The one input that is not an event is the seed — our own guid
   and name, which arrive in the `POST /session` response because no `SMSG_*`
   says "you are guid N". It is recorded on `state.seed` so a replay is explicit
   about it.

**Extension point.** `apply()` is a switch on opcode and every world write goes
through `upsertNearby()`. Landing a new event means: add the schema in
`src/protocol.ts`, add one `case` in `src/state.ts`, and derive rather than
duplicate if it belongs to `self`. The social families live in
`src/protocol-social.ts` and `src/state-social.ts` instead — the same two
steps, one file over in each case. `src/guid.ts` is the leaf both halves of the
protocol import for `guidSchema`; it exists so `protocol-social.ts` never
reaches back into `protocol.ts` at value level, which is a module-eval cycle
`tsc` cannot see.

## Running things

```bash
bun test sdk                 # the whole suite, no game stack needed
bunx tsc --noEmit -p sdk     # strict typecheck of src, test and examples

# live checks, need the stack up; not part of bun test. Both read
# WRATHBENCH_MODULE_SECRET from the environment and send it as the bearer
# credential — without it the module answers 401 unauthorized.
docker compose -f infra/compose.yml exec runner bun sdk/examples/live-slice.ts
docker compose -f infra/compose.yml exec runner bun sdk/examples/live-move.ts
```

Tests run against an in-process `Bun.serve` stub (`test/server.ts`) that speaks
the same HTTP and WebSocket shapes and replays fixture frames. All fixtures are
hand-written from PROTOCOL.md with invented names — nothing is captured from a
running game (`CLAUDE.md`).

## Dependencies

Zod, and only at the external boundary: `src/protocol.ts` (with
`src/protocol-social.ts`) validates module messages and hands plain TypeScript
types to everything downstream. Transport is
Bun's built-in `fetch` and `WebSocket`.
