/**
 * The typed event stream over `GET /events?token=...`.
 *
 * Three things this owns:
 *   - decoding frames into `GameEvent`s (protocol.ts does the schema work);
 *   - delivery: listeners, `waitFor`, and an `AsyncIterable` view;
 *   - continuity: `seq` is a per-session counter, so a reconnect that skipped
 *     events is detectable, and is surfaced as an explicit `stream_gap` event
 *     rather than being papered over. The state cache is only as trustworthy as
 *     the stream it was fed, so a gap has to be visible in-band.
 *
 * Buffering matters more than it looks. `POST /session` blocks for the whole
 * login handshake, which means the login events arrive while the caller is
 * awaiting the HTTP response. `waitFor` therefore searches the retained buffer
 * *before* waiting for future events.
