/**
 * The state cache: a pure fold over the event stream.
 *
 * Two rules, both from docs/CONTRACTS.md, and both load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. **Nothing is invented.** A field exists on the cache only if an event
 *     carried it. Nothing that no whitelisted opcode carries gets a default —
 *     `health` is `undefined`, not `0`, and `nearby` is empty rather than
 *     guessed from chat senders. A model reading `undefined` knows it has not
 *     observed the thing; a model reading `0` believes something false.
 *  2. **Replayable.** `StateCache.replay(events, seed)` over the same events
 *     produces the same cache as feeding them live. That is what makes the
 *     trajectory log sufficient to reconstruct what the model could see.
 *
 * Every observed field group carries the `seq`/`ts` it came from, so staleness
 * is legible — which matters most for position: our own is written by the login
 * verify, then by our create block, then by every `WB_MOVE_PROGRESS` while we
 * walk, and a reader can always see which.
 *
 * ### The update-object fold
 *
 * `SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT` is already delta-shaped on the wire (full object on
 * first sight, sparse field deltas after), and the fold preserves that rather
 * than flattening it: `create` populates a `NearbyObject`, `values` merges
 * field by field with each field keeping the seq/ts of the block that carried
 * it, `outOfRange` and `SMSG_DESTROY_OBJECT` prune. Everything writes through
 * one seam, `upsertNearby`.
 *
 * The typed groups (`health`, `power`, `level`) are *derived* from the raw
 * `fields` record and only when the derivation is complete — see
 * `deriveGauges`. Name resolution is a join, not an observation: query answers
 * land in `names`/`creatures` and are attached to whatever is in view.
