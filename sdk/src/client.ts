/**
 * The typed client over mod-wrathbench.
 *
 * One method per PROTOCOL.md request, exact shapes, no cleverness. This is the
 * surface the model programs against, so it is deliberately boring.
 *
 * ### The two error channels
 *
 * PROTOCOL.md separates transport/request errors (HTTP non-2xx) from game-level
 * errors (events on the WebSocket). The split is not quite "HTTP vs WS",
 * because `POST /session` is synchronous and therefore reports *game* outcomes
 * — `char_create_failed_code_<N>`, `login_failed`, `timeout` — as HTTP status
 * codes too. So:
 *
 *   - `WrathTransportError`  — the request never got an answer (socket refused,
 *     non-JSON body, abort). Always thrown.
 *   - `WrathRequestError`    — the module answered `{ ok: false }`. Always
 *     thrown, and carries `kind: "request" | "game"` so a caller can tell
 *     `token_in_use` (fix your call) from `char_create_failed_code_47` (the
 *     game said no). The game-level ones are *also* on the event stream.
 *
 * Anything the server decides after an action is acked never appears here at
 * all: it arrives as an event, because that is how a client would learn of it.

   * Fight a target until it (or we) drops.
   *
   * Owns the whole melee loop, because every part of it turned out to be
   * load-bearing on live runs:
   *
   *   - **facing**. A synthesized character never auto-faces the way a client
   *     does, and the server drops a swing that is not facing its victim. So
   *     the target is faced before the first swing and re-faced every
   *     `refaceIntervalMs` — through `faceQuietly`, because the module refuses
   *     a `face` while a move is running and a fight must not end over that.
   *   - **re-approach**. Creatures wander and get knocked around; if the
   *     target drifts beyond `meleeRange` the loop walks back in and swings
   *     again.
   *   - **approach**. The first swing is issued from melee range, not from
   *     wherever the character happened to be standing: a `killTarget` on
   *     something 50 yards off used to spend its whole timeout out of reach and
   *     land zero swings.
   *   - **death**. Ours ends the fight immediately (`player_died`); theirs is
   *     read off the observed health reaching zero.
   *   - **staying armed**. One `CMSG_ATTACKSWING` makes the server swing until
   *     it is cancelled; movement does not cancel it, and only `attack_stop`,
   *     a death, losing the target or re-targeting does. So `attack_stop` is
   *     sent only when the fight actually ended (`killed`, `player_died`,
   *     `aborted_low_health`) or when `disengage: true` was asked for.
   *     `timeout` and `lost` leave the character swinging — disarming a
   *     half-fought mob is how a character dies — and `attacking`/`detail` say
   *     so. If the helper throws, the character is likewise left as it was.
   *   - **re-arming**. If the server reports our auto-attack stopped
   *     (`SMSG_ATTACKSTOP`, not because we died) while the target is still
   *     alive and still ours, the loop swings again, rate-limited and capped.
   *
   * The default `timeout` (25s) is deliberately under the runner's 30s snippet
   * cap so an in-snippet call returns its verdict rather than being abandoned
   * mid-fight; a longer fight belongs in a background routine. An approach walk
   * that outlasts the deadline — before the first swing or after it — is folded
   * into `detail` and reported as `timeout` rather than thrown, so the outcome
   * stays a value.
   *
   * Returns a value for every game outcome and throws only for a refused
   * request. The caller is expected to loot afterwards: `killTarget` does not,
   * because a fight and a corpse are two decisions.
