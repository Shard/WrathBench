/**
 * Every SDK call settles on a later turn of the event loop, the way a real
 * client's call always does: a refusal answered locally (dead, no such
 * target, a bad argument) or a wait the buffer already answers sent nothing
 * and did no I/O, and without the turn a loop over it only ever yields to
 * microtasks. That loop starves every timer and every IPC message in the
 * process — the sandbox's ping included, so the host kills the sandbox as
 * blocked. Seen in a party run (2026-10-20): a background
 * `for (;;) await sdk.killTarget(u.guid)` that spun once the character died.
