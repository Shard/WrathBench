/**
 * The Stage-2 vertical slice, driven entirely through the SDK.
 *
 * This is the same ground infra/smoke/module-slice.ts covers, but where the
 * probe pokes the wire by hand, this asserts the SDK's own surface: `connect`
 * opens the event stream, `createSession` seeds the state cache,
 * `waitForChat` reads the echo back off the stream, and the cache — which was
 * never told anything except events plus the session seed — agrees.
 *
 * Not part of `bun test`: it needs a booted worldserver. Run it from inside the
 * compose network:
 *
 *   docker compose -f infra/compose.yml exec runner bun sdk/examples/live-slice.ts
 *
 * Override the target with MODULE_HOST / MODULE_PORT (default worldserver:8086).
