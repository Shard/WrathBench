/**
 * Emit `sdk/API.md` from the public `WrathClient` + `StateCache` surface.
 *
 * The doc is the model's reference for exact signatures, so it must never drift
 * from the code and must never advertise a method that does not exist (runs
 * have recorded models burning turns inventing `mineRock`-shaped helpers). This
 * generator is therefore self-checking against the *live* prototypes:
 *
 *   - every documented member must exist on the prototype (no invented rows),
 *   - every public prototype member must be documented or explicitly listed as
 *     internal plumbing (no silent undocumented surface),
 *
 * so adding a public method without a row here fails the build, and renaming or
 * removing one fails it too. The signature/purpose text is curated (runtime
 * introspection cannot recover TypeScript types); the *names* are verified.
 *
 * Output is deterministic — no date, no version, stable ordering — so
 * `docs:api:check` (regenerate + `git diff --exit-code`) only ever fires on a
 * real surface change or a hand-edit.
 *
 * Run: `bun run docs:api` (writes the file) — from anywhere; the path is
 * resolved from this file, not the cwd.

# WrathBench SDK reference

The exact call surface of the SDK your snippets program against, generated from
the public \`WrathClient\` and \`StateCache\`. Every method here exists; nothing
else does. There is **no** \`killNearest\`, \`goTo\`, \`navigate\`, \`trainSkill\`, or
skill-specific porcelain — do not invent methods. Gathering and talking to NPCs
go through \`interact\`, \`gossipHello\`, \`gossipSelect\`, \`useItem\`, and
\`castSpell\`. This file is larger than one snippet result, so read it in slices
(one \`## \` section, or lines filtered by name).

**Guids** are opaque decimal strings. Compare with \`===\`, use them as Map keys
and in template literals, and \`JSON.stringify\` them freely; get them from
\`state.units(...)\`, \`state.closest(...)\`, or event data. Never a number.

**Throw vs value.** A transport or request error always throws
(\`WrathTransportError\`, \`WrathRequestError\`), and so does the *absence* of an
outcome (\`EventTimeoutError\` — no result arrived within the timeout;
\`EventAbortedError\` — the wait was cancelled by its abort signal). Anything
the *game* decided is a returned value, not an exception: helpers return a
discriminated union with an \`ok\` boolean and a \`status\`, so \`if (!result.ok)\`
handles the normal failures (\`target_off_mesh\`, \`buy_failed\`, \`not_complete\`) without a
\`try\`. So: \`try\`/\`catch\` guards a broken or unanswered call; \`if (!ok)\` reads a
game answer you asked for.

**Two tiers.** A **helper** waits for the game's verdict and returns it. A **raw
action** is one opcode acknowledged over HTTP; its outcome arrives later on the
event stream (\`sdk.events\`). The tier is about where the outcome lands, not
about the argument type: every call that takes a guid takes a unit object or a
name in view just the same. Endpoints (session, health) return their HTTP
answer directly.

**Names are referents.** Anywhere a guid is taken — helpers, raw actions, and a
\`{ guid }\` / \`{ packedGuid }\` field inside a \`raw()\` payload — you may instead
pass the name of something you can currently see, exactly as a player points at
things by name. Resolution ignores case, spacing and apostrophes, then takes an
exact name, else a unique substring, else a unique near-miss (one typo, two in a
name of eight characters or more). One match acts; nothing matching, or two
things matching, refuses and lists what is in view — the SDK never picks between
referents. When the match was not exact the answer carries
\`resolved: { input, name, guid }\` so you can see what you acted on. Items work
the same way in place of a bag number (\`equipItem("Bronze Axe")\`), against what
you carry. Guids and opcode names are never fuzzed.

## Session & connection

In a snippet, \`await connect()\` (no arguments) opens the event stream on the
pre-constructed \`sdk\` client; call it once before \`createSession\`. (The library
form \`connect(options): Promise<WrathClient>\` is for host code that builds its
own client — not for snippets, where \`sdk\` already exists.) Then, on the client:

${table(CLIENT_ENDPOINTS)}

## Helpers (wait for a game verdict)

${table(CLIENT_HELPERS)}

## Raw actions (HTTP ack; outcome arrives as an event)

${table(CLIENT_RAW)}

## State reads (\`state.*\`)

\`state\` (alias for \`sdk.state\`) is a cache folded from events. \`state.self\`
(guid, name, level, position, zone and area — \`{ id, name }\`, the game's own
zone/subzone as the client names them on screen, e.g. "Elwynn Forest" /
"Northshire Valley" — health, targetGuid) and \`state.nearby\` (a Map
keyed by guid) are plain properties; the members below are getters and methods.
Observed fields are wrapped as \`{ value, seq, ts }\` — read \`.value\`. Every field
is \`undefined\` until an event carried it; \`undefined\` means unobserved, never
zero.

${table(STATE_ROWS)}

## Events (\`sdk.events\`)

Events are the server's \`SMSG_*\` packets as JSON, plus a few \`WB_*\` events for
what a client knows locally: \`WB_MOVE_RESULT\` / \`WB_MOVE_PROGRESS\` (own moves),
\`WB_AREA\` (\`{ mapId, zoneId, zoneName, areaId, areaName }\` on login and whenever
the zone or subzone changes, by foot, teleport or transfer — what \`state.self.zone\`
/ \`state.self.area\` are folded from),
\`WB_RIDE_PROGRESS\` (own position while a transport carries you, ≤1/s) and
\`WB_TRANSPORT_PROGRESS\` (\`{ guid, entry, pos, docked, progressMs, periodMs }\`
per transport in view, ≤1/s — the same facts as the \`docked\` column of
\`state.units()\`).

${table(EVENT_ROWS)}

## Errors & exported values

- \`WrathTransportError\` — the request never got a readable answer (thrown).
- \`WrathRequestError\` — the module answered \`{ ok: false }\` (thrown); carries
  \`code\`, \`status\`, and \`kind: "request" | "game"\`.
- \`EventTimeoutError\` — no event arrived within the timeout (thrown).
- \`EventAbortedError\` — the wait was cancelled by an \`AbortSignal\` before
  anything arrived (thrown; \`reason\` is what the signal was aborted with).
  Every wait honors the client's default signal (\`ConnectOptions.signal\`, a
  signal or a provider consulted per wait); in the runner sandbox that is the
  current snippet's ambient \`signal\`, aborted when the snippet is abandoned
  on timeout. A \`moveTo\` aborted mid-walk also issues \`stop\` before rethrowing.
- \`KNOWN_ERROR_CODES\`: ${errorCodes}.
- \`TRAINER_SPELL_STATE\`: ${trainerStates}.
