/**
 * The party records' producer (docs/proposals/GROUP-PLAY.md §6): `group`,
 * `instance` and `kill` transitions, latched in the sandbox child as the
 * events that carry them arrive, for the host's state sample to drain and
 * write as milestones — the way deaths and flights are (`ipc.ts`,
 * `DeathSignal`), and for the same reason: a 60s sample misses what happened
 * between two samples, and a reading off a state sample (a map id, say) is
 * not the server telling the client anything.
 *
 * Each one is read off a packet the server sends a client anyway:
 *
 * - **group**, from `SMSG_GROUP_LIST` (and the destroy, uninvite and
 *   set-leader packets around it) as the SDK's `state.group()` folds it.
 *   `joined` is a list arriving while not in a group, `left` the reverse,
 *   `changed` any other change of the group guid, the leader or the members.
 *   A process's first reading outside a group seeds silently; its first
 *   reading inside one is `joined` — the staged party's login list is the
 *   record that says the party existed for this run.
 * - **instance**, from the map transfer: the `WB_AREA` (or the reattaching
 *   `WB_SESSION_STATE`) that follows `SMSG_NEW_WORLD`, carrying the map with
 *   the module's `Map.dbc` reading of it, `instanceType`. Written when the map
 *   changed and the instance type with it: `entered` into a type other than
 *   0 (a continent), `left` back to 0. The first reading seeds silently (a
 *   resumed process inside an instance did not see it entered). Silent
 *   altogether until the module serves `instanceType`.
 * - **kill**, from `SMSG_PARTYKILLLOG` (`killerGuid`, `victimGuid`; `killer`
 *   and `victim` are read too), with the victim's `entry` from the unit cache
 *   — else from the victim's creature guid, which carries it, so a member out
 *   of sight of the kill still names it — and its `rank` from the creature
 *   query the cache holds. A victim of rank 0 is not recorded (an open-world
 *   run would write a line per rabbit), nor is a player; a victim whose rank
 *   was never answered is, without one, so no elite is lost to a missing
 *   query. `member` is whether the killer is this character or one of its
 *   group's members as the group list stood when the packet arrived: the
 *   credit a campaign's kill end reads (`end-conditions.ts`). Silent until
 *   the module taps the packet.
 *
 * Guids and ids only, never names: the record stays what the server said.
 * Pure over a narrow reading of the cache, so it is tested against fixture
 * events without a sandbox.
