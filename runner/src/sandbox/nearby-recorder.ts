/**
 * The nearby recorder: the sandbox child's watch on the units around the
 * character, latched for the host to drain into the live map's ring
 * (`../nearby.ts`). Row shapes are the contract in `../nearby-row.ts`.
 *
 * It reads the SDK client's state cache and nothing else — the `nearby` map
 * the update stream, the splines and the relayed movement fill, and the
 * creature-query answers the client already received — and never the
 * snippet's API: it sends no action and no raw opcode, consumes no event
 * queue, and nothing here is reachable from a snippet. What it reads is the
 * raw `position` and `motion` of each unit with their own timestamps, never
 * `units()` or `pointOf()`, which read a moving creature off its spline at the
 * moment of the call: the row keeps the spline itself, for the reader to play.
 *
 * A poll, like the trace recorder's. Every 500 ms each unit in view is compared
 * with what was last emitted for it — its motion by the identity of the
 * cache's `Observed` objects, its state by value — and a row is built only for
 * what changed: a scene of ~170 objects costs one pass over the map and a few
 * rows. Every row is stamped with the poll that saw it, so the rows are in the
 * order they were seen and a reader's fold is causal; a motion carries its own
 * packet time beside that (`NearbyMotion.t`), so a spline the poll reached late
 * is still played from when it began. The only hooks are broadcast
 * subscriptions (`events.on`) for the two packets that mean the stream
 * (re)joined the world, after which the next poll restates everything.
 *
 * Bounded: the buffer drops its oldest rows past `cap` and counts the drops,
 * which the host logs to stderr. A child whose host stopped draining loses
 * the oldest rows, not its memory.
