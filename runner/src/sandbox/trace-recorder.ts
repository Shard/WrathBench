/**
 * The trace recorder: the sandbox child's own watch on the character, latched
 * for the host to drain the way `deathSignals` and `flightSignals` are
 * (entry.ts). It reads the SDK client's state cache and event stream — the
 * things the cache already holds, with their own observation timestamps — and
 * never the snippet's API; nothing here is reachable from a snippet, and
 * nothing here observes anything the cache did not. Row shapes and cadence are
 * the storage contract in `../trace-row.ts`.
 *
 * Mostly a poll, deliberately. Position, gauges, flags, level, XP, the target
 * and the aura slots all sit in the cache with a `seq`/`ts` on each, so a
 * 250 ms comparison against what was last emitted costs a handful of reads and
 * no listener on the event firehose; the cache's own `Observed.ts` stamps each
 * row with when the thing was seen, not when the poll ran. Events are hooked
 * only for what the cache does not keep: a cast in progress (`SMSG_SPELL_START`
 * to `SMSG_SPELL_GO`), the packets that put the character somewhere it did not
 * walk to (a jump), the own spline a flight rides, and the two packets that
 * mean the stream (re)joined the world, and the character's own chat lines
 * as the server echoes them back. Every hook is a broadcast
 * subscription (`events.on`), never a consuming queue the model's event
 * batches also draw from.
 *
 * The character sheet (`trace-sheet.ts`) is the one part that is not cheap
 * to read at level 43 — sixty-odd carried items, 25 quest slots, 128 skill
 * slots — so it is read only after a packet that can change it (an update or
 * destroy, a faction packet), at most once every `TRACE_SHEET_MIN_GAP_MS`,
 * and its changes go in a 'state' row of their own. It stays unobserved
 * (`null`) until this process has folded the character's own create block:
 * a restarted child reattaches to its session with a `WB_SESSION_STATE` that
 * restates the position and the level and nothing else, and the cache's
 * empty bags then mean "not seen", not "empty". Reputation waits the same
 * way for the login's `SMSG_INITIALIZE_FACTIONS`. Item names and quest
 * requirements go to the host once per id (`TraceDict`), and turn-ins
 * (`qdone`) as the server's receipts arrive.
 *
 * Bounded: the buffer drops its oldest rows past `cap` and counts the drops,
 * which the host logs. A child whose host stopped draining for an hour loses
 * the oldest hour's rows, not its memory.
