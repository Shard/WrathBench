/**
 * Ownership of what model code starts, for the entrypoint loop (a probing
 * spike): every timer and every event listener created while a snippet or a
 * program deploy is the current async context belongs to it, and is removed
 * when it ends — a snippet when it returns (or is abandoned), a deploy when it
 * is replaced, unloaded or halted. "Nothing a snippet starts outlives it."
 *
 * Ownership keys on the async context (the sandbox's AsyncLocalStorage), never
 * on stack frames: Bun elides a strict-mode tail call's frame, so a module
 * frame can simply be missing from a stack. SDK plumbing is kept out of every
 * owner by running it with no context at all (the ambient `connect()`, the
 * deploy-time reconnect), and by construction the rest of it is already
 * outside: Bun carries no async context into WebSocket callbacks, so event
 * ingestion — and every debounce timer the SDK arms there — runs unowned.
 * What an owner does collect from the SDK is per-call: the timeouts and
 * listeners of waits the model started, which the owner's abort has already
 * settled by the time they are cleared.
 *
 * A listener registered from owned code is wrapped to run inside its owner's
 * context, so a timer that handler starts belongs to the same owner, and a
 * handler that throws is reported through `onHandlerError` instead of breaking
 * the SDK's dispatch for every other listener of that event.
 *
 * Installed only in the entrypoint loop. The snippet loop's sandbox never
 * loads this, so its timers and listeners behave as they always have.
 */
