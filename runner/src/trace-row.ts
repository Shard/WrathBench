/**
 * The trace: a fine-grained record of the character's own position and state,
 * written beside the 60 s `state` rows so the map can play a run back as
 * movement rather than as a slide show.
 *
 * The shapes here are the storage contract shared with the trace's readers
 * (the segment encoder, the viewer, the publisher): one row per observation in
 * run.sqlite `trace`, its only home, and the `TraceState`
 * keys a 'key' row carries whole and a 'state' row carries as a delta. They
 * are fixed by that contract; a change here is a change for every reader.
 *
 * Nothing in it is new observation. The recorder (`sandbox/trace-recorder.ts`)
 * reads the SDK's own state cache and event stream inside the sandbox child,
 * and the writer (`trace.ts`) persists what the host drains on the state
 * ticker. The model sees none of it.
 *
 * Beside the unit state rides the character sheet (`TraceSheet`): money, what
 * is worn and carried, the quest log's raw counters, visible reputation and
 * skills, as numbers and ids. Its lists are increments: a 'key' row states
 * each whole, a 'state' row carries only the rows that changed. The names a
 * reader shows them by travel once per id, as the dictionary a drain carries
 * (`TraceDict`), never on a row.
