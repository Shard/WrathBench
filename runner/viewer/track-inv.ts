/**
 * A track's inventory as changes: the codec `trackFrom` encodes the replay
 * track's `inv` with and the dashboard's `itemsAt` folds back.
 *
 * The track used to carry the whole inventory on every point where its stored
 * text changed, and on a long-lived character that was most of the file: a
 * level-43 freeplay character with full bags was 30 MB of track, four-fifths
 * of it whole inventories repeating each other, re-uploaded on every publisher
 * pass while the run was live. Each reading is now the slots that changed.
 *
 * **Format** (`TrackInventory`):
 *
 * - `items`: every distinct item the readings name, `[name, itemId, quality]`,
 *   null where the stored row carried none, referenced by index. It is keyed
 *   by the whole triple rather than by the item id, because the stored name is
 *   not a function of the id: an item with a random suffix stores the suffix in
 *   its name, so two copies of one id can be carried at once under two names.
 * - `at`: the readings, oldest first, each on the index of the track point it
 *   surfaces at (the join `trackFrom` documents), in one of two forms:
 *   - `[point, patch]`: the reading before it — or empty bags, for the first —
 *     with each `[bag, slot, item]` (`[bag, slot, item, count]` when the stack
 *     is not 1) filling its slot and each bare `[bag, slot]` emptying it.
 *     `bag` is -1 for a worn item, whose `slot` is the equipment slot; a
 *     carried one has the SDK's own pair (`ItemSample`).
 *   - `[point, null, whole]`: the reading exactly as stored, rows and all. Used
 *     where a patch cannot say it: a row with no slot (every run recorded
 *     before the slot columns), two rows on one slot, rows stored out of the
 *     order a patch rebuilds, and anything after a reading like that.
 *
 * A patched reading is rebuilt in the order the recorder writes one — worn by
 * equipment slot, then the backpack, then the worn bags in slot order, each by
 * slot — with each row's keys in `itemSamplesOf`'s order and absent fields
 * absent. That is what makes a reading folded from patches the reading the
 * track would have carried whole, which is the property the tests and the
 * encoder's own order check hold it to.
 *
 * Imports nothing but wire types, like `trace.ts`: the dashboard reaches it
 * over the `@viewer/*` alias.
