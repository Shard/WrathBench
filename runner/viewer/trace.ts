/**
 * Trace v1: one character's movement and unit state, packed per five-minute
 * window — the codec the viewer serves, the publisher uploads and the
 * dashboard's player decodes.
 *
 * The recorder (`runner/src/`) writes rows to `run.sqlite` table `trace`:
 * `key` (full state), `pos` (a position sample, `{"jump":1}` when it was not
 * reached by travel), `state` (the changed keys only; `auras` whole) and
 * `flight` (a taxi takeoff, `{"to":{map,x,y,z},"durationMs"}`). This file turns
 * one window of them into a segment and back.
 *
 * **Segment.** One run × one UTC-aligned window `[t0, t1)`, `t1 = t0 + SEG_MS`,
 * self-contained: it decodes alone. Columnar JSON, keys in this order:
 *
 * - `v` 1; `run`; `t0`, `t1` (epoch ms); `q: {p: 10, o: 1024}` — positions in
 *   1/10 yd, orientation in 1/1024 turn. Decoders read `q`, not the constants.
 * - `k`, the keyframe. `p: [map, x, y, z, o]` quantised absolute — where the
 *   character was at `t0` (interpolated between the samples either side when
 *   they are close and continuous) or null if no position was known. `pt` is
 *   the ms from `t0` at which that position was observed, absent when 0. `s`
 *   is the full `TraceState` at `t0`. `f: [map, x, y, z, ms]` is a flight still
 *   in the air at `t0`: its destination and the ms left.
 * - `dt`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `o`: one entry per sample. `dt` is ms since the
 *   previous sample (the first since `t0`); the rest are integer deltas from
 *   the previous sample (the first from `k.p`, or from 0 when it is null),
 *   `o` wrapped to the short way round. A null z or o carries the last one.
 * - `cuts: [[i, map]]`: sample `i` was a jump or landed on another map, and
 *   `map` is the map from it on. Never interpolated into. With `k.p` null the
 *   first sample is always one.
 * - `flights: [[i, map, x, y, z, ms]]`: sample `i` is a taxi takeoff; it flies
 *   straight to the quantised absolute destination over `ms`.
 * - `ev: [[ms, kind, value]]`: state changes after the keyframe, `ms` from `t0`,
 *   `kind` a `TraceState` key, in recorded order.
 *
 * **The character sheet** (`TraceSheet`: money, `equip`, `bags`, `inv`, `dur`,
 * `quests`, `rep`, `skills`) rides the same keyframe and event list, as
 * numbers and ids. `k.s` holds each observed sheet key whole; one it lacks is
 * not recorded, never empty. A list's event is a patch, not a value: the rows
 * that changed, whole, and a row of only its key fields (`[slot]`,
 * `[bag, slot]`, `[factionId]`, `[skillId]`) for one that went; a list after
 * null is whole, and a null event is back to unobserved. `qdone` events carry
 * the quest ids the server confirmed turned in at that moment: they append,
 * are never compared with what came before, and are in no keyframe. Two
 * dictionaries make the segment decode alone, each holding exactly the ids
 * its keyframe and events reference: `items: {id: [quality, name]}`, the item
 * template's name, and `qreq: {id: [r0, r1, r2, r3, [itemId, n]...]}`, the
 * counts each quest needs. The unit-state readers (`stateAt`) never see the
 * sheet; `sheetAt` folds it.
 *
 * **Chat** rides the event list too: `[ms, "chat", [kind, text]]`, one per
 * line the character said (`TraceChat`: say, party, raid, yell, whisper or
 * emote, and the model's own text, at most `CHAT_MAX_CHARS`). Like `qdone`
 * it is an event and never state: in no keyframe, never compared, every line
 * kept. It was added after the first segments were published, under the rule
 * below, so a window that closed before it says nothing, which reads as no
 * line said.
 *
 * **Versioning.** A decoder ignores keys it does not know and skips events of
 * kinds it does not know, so a field or an event kind is added without a bump;
 * `v` moves only when a meaning changes, and a v1 decoder refuses anything else.
 *
 * **Playback** (`sampleAt`): positions interpolate linearly, orientation the
 * short way round. A sample is held, not interpolated out of, into a cut,
 * across a map change and across a gap longer than `GAP_MS`; a takeoff flies
 * straight to its destination over its duration and holds there until the
 * landing sample.
 *
 * Imports nothing but wire types, like `sessions.ts`: the dashboard reaches it
 * over the `@viewer/*` alias at runtime, so nothing server-side may follow it
 * into the browser bundle. The sqlite side is `trace-db.ts`.

 * Rows before `t0` are context: they seed the keyframe and are never emitted.
 * The keyframe is exact when the context reaches back to a `key` row (the
 * recorder writes one per live window, so `CONTEXT_MS` holds three), and a
 * flight in the air at `t0` carries on only when its takeoff is in it. With no
 * `key` row in the context the window's own first `key` row seeds the
 * keyframe, folding in the state of the rows before it inside the window (their
 * positions stay samples). Rows at or after `t1` are ignored. A window with no
 * rows of its own still encodes — to a keyframe and nothing else — so whether
 * that is worth serving is the caller's call.
 *
 * `dict` answers the item names and quest requirements the sheet references
 * (`trace_dict`); without one, or for an id it does not know, the segment
